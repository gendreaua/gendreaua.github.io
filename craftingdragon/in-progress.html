                <p>This is my first time trying to make an animal, so far been working on it about a month. 
                    It still has a long way to go but at least it looks like a head, not sure if it looks like a 
                    cow though.

                <p>This is my first time trying to make a scoodie. That is a hat, scarf, glove set. I am working on this
                    to hopefully have it completed the next time the SSS Sea Fox has an charity auction. Once Covid can be
                    controlled and we can go to functions again.

                <p>My dad taught me how to cross stitch since I was a kid. It is something that I will always remember
                    how to do. I always have one or two started cross stitch projects.

                <p>This is a crochet bunny hat and diaper cover. I used to make a number of these as gifts and then had to stop when I went back to school to get my 
                    bachelors degree. This one is needing a clean up and missing it's buttons, otherwise it's almost done.
                    I could put a tail on it but for babies that are always on their backs, it just seems so uncomfortable.

                <p>I would say that this is my ETERNAL project. I started this about 10 years ago and had to stop shortly 
                    after my first child was born. This was how far I got working hard at it for 2 years before it got folded
                    up in the unfinished drawer. I do look forward to trying it again once the kids are no longer quite so little.
